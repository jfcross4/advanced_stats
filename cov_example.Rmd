## Formulas from last time...

when X and Y are independent: $Var[X + Y] = Var[X] + Var[Y]$

more generally: $Var[X + Y] = Var[X] + Var[Y] + 2\cdot Cov[X,Y]$

where:

$Cov[X,Y] = E[X \cdot Y] - E[X]\cdot[Y]$

# From the last homework...

X = “The # of heads on the first flip”

Y = “The # of heads on the second flip”

For a FAIR coin we found:

* $E[X] = \frac{1}{2}$
* $E[Y] = \frac{1}{2}$
* $E[X \cdot Y] = \frac{1}{4}$

For a coin that has a half chance of being biased towards heads (2/3rds heads) and a half chance of being bised towards tails (2/3rds tails):

* $E[X] = \frac{1}{2}$
* $E[Y] = \frac{1}{2}$
* $E[X \cdot Y] = \frac{5}{18}$

It's also true that for both coins:

$Var[X] = Var[Y] = \frac{1}{4}$

For each coin, please find:

a. $Cov[X,Y]$
b. $Var[X + Y]$

Why is $Var[X + Y]$ larger for one of the coins?
